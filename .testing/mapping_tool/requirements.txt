# Requirements Base Mode (~10MB)
# 基础模式 - 只包含核心依赖，AI分析器使用简化模式

# Core performance monitoring
psutil>=5.9.0

# Python built-in modules are included by default:
# - asyncio, json, re, os, sys (built-in)
# - concurrent.futures (built-in since Python 3.2)
# - dataclasses (built-in since Python 3.7)
# - typing (built-in since Python 3.5)
# - weakref, functools (built-in)

# - Document parsing without NLP enhancements
# - Basic regex-based analysis
# - File I/O operations
# - Graceful fallback when NLP libraries are missing
